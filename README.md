Thinkfulbnb is a vacation rental website that allows people to rent out their homes to people who are seeking short-term accommodations in that locale. Thinkfulbnb hosts rent out different kinds of properties, including single rooms, apartments, and unique living spaces such as yachts, houseboats, yurts, tiny houses, and even renovated medieval castles. Project was constructed using CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap 4 to display content and make the web page responsive on mobile devices and desktops. While making this project, I gained a lot of experience in using bootstrap and media queries to make a web page responsive.
